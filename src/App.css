/**
In summary, index.css is for global, application-wide styles, while App.css is for styles specific to the App component 
or any other individual component's styles. This separation helps in organizing and maintaining styles more effectively. 
^^ seems like I can just stick everything in index.css for now, this shouldn't be too complicated frontend wise

client side:
replace filler usernames (player 1-4) with state so they can updated
replace pt values with state so they can be updated


server side:
know when there are 4 people in the server (start game)
be able to deal a deck of cards (slice into 4)
turn based element

gameplay elements ideas:
Everyone dealt 13 cards -- JS shuffle algorithm already obtained
slicing into 4 regions (0, 13), (13, 26), (26, 39), (39, 52) that gets passed into setHand

2 of clubs played automatically -- server-side logic, turns go in order
everyone has to play the same suit if they have it -- server-side logic
determine winner/how many pts they get

breaking into hearts: server-side variable, js filler

pt counts: displayed on React side, kept track of by server

extra stuff (low prio or later):
sleep for 1s after last card played, display who won the trick
shooting the moon
passing 3 cards

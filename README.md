# --Step 2/4--

Hearts

4 players, when someone hits x pts (ex. 100) the game ends and the person with the lowest wins. 

Each round:

Everyone is dealt 13 cards. Each player passes 3 cards to their left. <-- this feature is the most complicated and will likely be implemented last

2 of clubs starts. Each trick, the person who won the previous trick will play the first card. This card cannot be hearts if it hasn't been broken into yet. 

Everyone will follow with a card of the same suit if they have it. The person who has the highest card of the starting suit wins the trick and takes all of the cards. 

Breaking into hearts: one can break into hearts if they don't have the suit played, which opens up starting with hearts to anyone else. 

Hearts are each worth 1 point, and the queen of spades is worth 13 points. The goal is to get the least amount of points possible. 

If someone happens to get all 26 points, they 'shoot the moon' and all other players get 26 points while they get 0. <-- implemented 2nd to last (if we even get there)
